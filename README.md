# UserDashboard
This Angular version 17.3.7. project showcases a user management application that leverages Angular's latest features to interact with a remote API. It seamlessly fetches user data from an external API source and presents it in an intuitive user interface.

## Key Features:

1- User Listing: Display users fetched from a remote API, presenting their essential details such as name, email, and avatar.
2- User Details: View detailed information about each user, including their profile picture, full name, and contact details.
3- Search Functionality: Enable users to efficiently search for specific users by name, ID, or email address, enhancing usability and convenience.
4- Loading Spinner: Implement a loading spinner to provide visual feedback to users during data retrieval, ensuring a seamless and responsive user experience.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding
Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build
Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests
Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests
Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
